            <p>LISP, short for list processing, is a functional language developed by 
                John McCarthy in 1959. It was first used for processing punched cards, and is now used 
                in symbolic AI programs, embedded systems programs, and some other applications. While its 
                popularity has faded over the years, LISP was groundbreaking for its time. LISP is no longer
                 actively supported, but some programmers still opt to use it for specific applications.<br />
