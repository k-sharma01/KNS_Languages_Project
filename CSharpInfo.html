            <p>C# is a language created by Microsoft first released in 2002. Anders Hejlsberg is regarded as the founder and 
                brains behind the language. It has evolved from a basic object-oriented language to a robust 
                software tool with modern tools. It is most often used for building mobile and desktop applications. 
                C# is still widely used today, and still supported by Microsoft.<br />
